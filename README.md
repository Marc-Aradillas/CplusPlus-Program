# CplusPlus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created an app that populates a simple user interface to make selections of a initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and the number of years to be displayed on two tables which displays the return on investment in each table one with and one without a monthly deposit. This soives the problem of having to calculate your return on investment with or without a deposit based on you rate of return with a table that is displayed promptly for the user. The app is simple and easy to use.

# What did you do particularly well?
I believe what I did well was created a simple user interface and built C++ calculations appropriately in the programming langauage to populate the correct numbers for user financials. I did well in creating two seperate header and cpp files to organize my assessors and getters. The organization of placing members in private or public to make accessible and non-accessible information flow well in the code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think i could enhance the code by maybe adding some additional formatting and or include additional information on the tables. I think the code could be made more secure and maybe some validation could be implemented to ensure user input is accurate for choice selection and input.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?  
The most challenging to write was the investment.cpp file. organization is important when writing code to me. So putting the getters and setters in place and deriving those calls back from the header file proved difficult because I typed in the wrong data type or my syntax and spelling was wrong. To make the calculation be compiled to populate correctly required me to review the data type and operators to ensure correct output for user request.

# What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I have placed references in the top of my files where I derived information to help build my program.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of setting and geting informations and creating functions and organizing files in header and cpp seperately with classes in place to help program compilation. The knowledge of calculating numbers to output a result for respective service. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping it simple and using loops to cycle through user interface. It's readable by follwoing industry best practices of naming conventions for object, members, etc. This program is adaptable becuase you could easuily integrate it with other programming langauged to streamline this product and increase it's potential as a financial tool.
